# Anchors

## Non-inclusive Top Rope Anchors Checklist

- [ ] Anchor **ensured to be "SERENE"** or similar.
- [ ] *Two* locking carabiners **are present** at the masterpoint.
(Or at least one locking carabiner and one non-locking carabiner.)
- [ ] Rope **has minimal abrasion potential**. (Extend anchor or protect rope if needed.)

### Non-inclusive Before detaching Personal Anchor System (PAS) (or equivalent) Checklist

- [ ] Next attachment to anchor **visually verified**.
    - [ ] **Next attachment double checked.** (Your partner is not there to verify.)
- [ ] If lowering:
    - [ ] Verify **stopper knot tied** at the end of rope. (Yes, again, no matter how short the route is.)
    - [ ] Communicate with belayer to ensure that he/she knows you are going **on belay** (and not rapelling).
- [ ] If rapelling:
    - [ ] Verify **stopper knots tied** for ***each end*** of rope.
    - [ ] Verify **both ropes are secured in the rappel device**.
    - [ ] Verify **backup safety knot tied** (e.g. Prusik below an extended rappel).
        - [ ] Verify the backup safety knot is **secured to a strength point** on your harness.
    - [ ] Ensure belayer is **prepared for a fireman's belay**.
- [ ] Next attachment to anchor **physically tested**.
    - [ ] **Verified that entire weight supported by next attachment.** (You are about to trust your life to it.)
    - [ ] Previous attachment to anchor **completely slack**.
