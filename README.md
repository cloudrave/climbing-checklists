# What are climbing checklists?

Pilots have checklists for just about everything. These tools help prevent accidents
from negligence, and they are an invaluable tool in aviation.

Climbers may benefit from a similar methodology.

**Remember: These checklists do not represent *everything* that must be done to be safe.
In fact, there is *no way to guarantee your safety while climbing*, as climbing is an
inherently dangerous sport. When you climb, you do so at your own risk of injury
or death.**

Ideally this list helps you reduce the liklihood that you will have a "bad day".

# How to Use a Checklist

Say, *for demonstration purposes only*, we have the following checklist entitled
"Attitude Check":

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
    - [ ] Verified.
- [ ] 3

Some things to know about checklists:

- Order matters.
- Some items should be cross-verified by the climbing partner, as indicated by the sub-item "Verified" for
the second item on this checklist.

# The Checklists

## Before Leaving Home

- Gear Preparation and Inspection

## At the Crag (or Gym)

- Before Climbing with a Single Rope
    - Lead Addendum
    - Trad Addendum

## Back at Home

- Gear Storage

# Contributing

Please, please, please contribute your thoughts (via Pull Requests or Issues).
*I am a novice climber and have little idea about safety,* which is why it's
essential for the community to come together to develop these best practices.

All of these checklists will always be incomplete and flawed, but with enough
perspectives, we can make this a resource that can help save lives.

## Justification of Checklist Items
