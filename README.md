# What are climbing checklists?

Pilots have checklists for just about everything. These tools help prevent accidents
from negligence, and they are an invaluable tool in aviation.

Climbers may benefit from a similar methodology.

# Important Disclaimer

**Remember: These checklists do not represent *everything* that must be done to be safe.
They are *non-inclusive* of all best practices.**

**In fact, there is *no way to guarantee your safety while climbing*, as climbing is an
inherently dangerous sport. When you climb, you do so at your own risk of injury
or death.**

Ideally this list helps you *reduce the liklihood* that you will have a "bad day".

**There is no substitute for your own personal safety judgement. This list is just to externally *double-check that judgement.***

# How to Use a Checklist

Say, *for demonstration purposes only*, we have the following checklist:

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
    - [ ] Verified by partner.
- [ ] 3

Some things to know about checklists:

- Order matters.
- Some items should be cross-verified by the climbing partner, as indicated by the sub-item "Verified by partner" for
the second item on this checklist.

# Contributing

Please, please, please contribute your thoughts (via Pull Requests or Issues).
*I am a novice climber and have little idea about safety,* which is why it's
essential for the community to come together to develop these best practices.

All of these checklists will always be incomplete and flawed, but with enough
perspectives, we can make this a resource that can help save lives.
